# Solana Action: Mint NFT

This example includes a Solana Action built in Go using the Gin framework and Solana-Go-SDK. It
provides an API endpoint for minting an NFT.

Navigate to `./examples/gin` and start the application:

``` go
go run main.go
```

The server will start running on <http://localhost:8081>.

The endpoint for the Action is: <http://localhost:8080/api/actions/mint_nft>
